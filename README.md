# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project is a web-based application that provides movie recommendations based on a selected movie. It utilizes a machine learning model to compute similarity between movies and recommends similar ones. The application is built using Streamlit for the frontend and uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch movie posters.
